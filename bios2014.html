Funniest non-frisbee moment: <br>
<br>
This May, Gina and I had our wedding which several of the Polar Bears attended. It was the very end of the night and everyone was on their way out. AJ decided he need to head into the bar (quite literally) for a night-cap, and neglected to see the enormous glass window that separated the bar from the patio. He walked head first into the glass, knocking him back several feet. Needless to say, AJ will always hold a special place in me and Gina's memories of our wedding night.</div>

			<div class='bio-q'>Funniest moment of the season thus far?</div>
			<div class='bio-a'>The funniest moment of the season thus far was when Greenie and I went rabbit hunting during the retreat. We found some discarded nets in the shed and pursued our hapless prey about a quarter-mile before it finally made its mistake. By venturing onto an open flat deck it limited its escapes or hiding places. As we stemmed onto the deck from opposite corners it suddenly became alert, realizing the peril of its situation. It made a dash along the house line towards Greenie's side, which was undoubtedly its undoing, as Greenie is a far quicker rabbit catcher than myself. Moving more quickly than I have seen in any of our ultimate games, Greenie cut off its intended line. I closed as the rabbit turned and began to bolt between us. I dove and brought my net crashing down over its head.  Needless to say, we were both shocked, as we had no expectation of actually catching the beast. However, we were not as shocked as our rabbit, which a moment later fell to its side and lay motionless. I had heard that once caught a rabbit's heart beat so fast it would burst, but I had not believed the legend until that moment. Suddenly heart stricken that our game had resulted in the death of such an innocent creature, I disentangled my net and approached it to see if there was any hope of its survival. No sooner had I done this than the rabbit revealed its cunning ruse. It leapt to my shoulder, and I fell back in shock as it dashed away. Greenie burst out laughing as I hit the deck rather hard, but even I was smiling.<br>

			<div class='bio-q'>How many clones of yourself would it take to beat up a silverback gorilla in a fight (no weapons)?</div>
			<div class='bio-a'>Silverback gorillas are scary. Since my army of clones is disposable in nature I will bury it underneath an ever increasing mound of clones. An adult silverback gorilla can reach a height of 1.8m, and a mass of ~510lbs. Using that height, I propose burying it under a solid hemisphere 2.8m in radius. As the volume of the hemisphere is 2/3*pi*r^3, I come up with a total volume of 45.98m^3. However, we need to subtract off the volume of the gorilla inside. Assuming a gorilla has a similar density to water (wikipedia is sadly absent on that front), a gorilla has a total volume of ~0.25m^3. As I am neutrally buoyant, this leads to a calculation of the volume of a single Alex as 0.06m^3. It is a straightforward calculation to show that the total number of clones necessary to fill the volume is 766.2. However, this should likely be rounded to only 2 significant figures so the total answer is 770, with the remainder taking part in victory celebrations.</div>
