The contents flew everywhere and I was dappled with milkshake refuse.  This did not go unnoticed.</div>

			<div class='bio-a'>It's a funny story actually, now at least. I was 13 on a family vacation to Mexico. My parents decided it would be a good idea to see the fortresses around Guadalajara.  Needless to say I was none too pleased, but what choice did I have?  We walked around outside in the baking sun for all morning.  Had to be at least 105 degrees by midday. At about one my parents finally agreed to stop for lunch. Since they knew it had been such a unbearable morning they said I could have whatever I wanted for being "such a trooper".  That is when I made the fateful decision to request a milkshake. We went on one wild goose chase involving no milkshakes, one goose actually, a brush with death, a bar fight, and a night in mexican prison.  All I was left with was the nickname Milkshake and a goose named Horchata.</div>

Lucas v. Chimp episodes I-V<br>
The  Potlatch 2010 circuit<br>
And a story: My first day back with Polar Bears of the season Lisa "Stone Cold Troll" Pitcaithley offered to let me sit on her bucket (an accessory I have advocated against from the very beginning). I was tired though, and surprised at this turn of kindness so I accepted. Lisa promptly kicked the bucket out from underneath me, causing me to lose my balance and fall. In return, I attempted to kick the upended bucket but my foot hooked underneath it sending her container (with all her belongings inside) flying into the air. "No!" Lisa said and lunged forward, attempting to stop the thing from hitting the ground full force. However the momentum of the bucket caused Lisa to lose her balance and fall forward at which point Lisa and the bucket tumbled over one another for what seemed like forever.</div>

Sidenote: I pioneered an unorthodox three paper opening (known as 'Triple Papes') that garnered me much notoriety in early 2010.  This has since been superseded by the more widely known 'Heavy Papes' strategy, in part due to the latter's guaranteed success assuming your opponent doesn't employ the same technique or the riskier 'Scissor Factory'.</div>

			<div class='bio-a'>I picked up a frisbee and threw a lot the summer before I started, then I went back to school (sophomore year, undergrad) and decided I was tired of being out of shape. I knew a couple of people on the team and had a passable backhand (despite stepping out with the wrong foot!) so I decided to try it out. The people I knew ended up quitting, but I loved the people and game I met and couldn't turn away.</div>

		<div class='bio-qa'>
			<div class='bio-q'>What other sports did you play before ultimate?</div>
			<div class='bio-a'>My main sport was soccer growing up. I also played tennis and golf, but only so I could play with my parents in their respective sports. I was good, but never played competitively besides soccer (and for a brief stint competitive ping pong). I've also got 4 years of high school marching band under my belt.</div>
		</div>
		<div class='bio-qa'>
			<div class='bio-q'>How did you start playing ultimate?</div>
			<div class='bio-a'>Dan Schneider (AP US History teacher at the time/ previous UCSB legend) recommended to my other brother Stephen to play pick-up ultimate at LPC as conditioning for high school soccer. I was a freshmen at the time, and I went along once or twice to condition for soccer as well. Stephen went on to have a great experience playing ultimate for UCSD. During my Junior year try-outs for soccer, I was cut and that subsequently ended my soccer career. My senior year, Allen Thoe (Math teacher/ UC Davis alumni) created a team for Foothill high school in Pleasanton. I saw the flier promoting the new team on my 18 birthday, which was a way better present than whatever my ex-girlfriend probably got me. Our team was very motivated to get better, and was very thankful to the Las Positas program for allowing us to practice with them to learn and improve.</div>
