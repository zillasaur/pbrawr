I didn't actually time it or measure the distance, but that was the pace. \n\nThroughout the day, I probably did 150 bicep pushups. I set up mirrors in my house so that I can easy look at myself when I do squats or push presses, and another mirror for push ups. Necrotistic huh \n\nAround 8:30 I drew a latter with chalk on my drive way and did latters. YouTube video to follow. Then inside, Bianca and I did a workout comprised of \n-10 25lb squats\n-5 pushups\n-30 Russian twists\n-25lb kettleball swings\n-10 23lb medicine ball slams\nRepeat 3 times. \n\nBianca got 6:50, and I got 4:29min.

I pushed myself really hard for the last 4-5 minutes having already placed a finish line in my head. When I crossed that line, I was sweaty, gasping for air, and exhausted. As I walked around regaining consciousness, I witnessed a college aged girl pull horizontally onto a one-way street, and then slowly back up onto a clearly red marked sidewalk. She ended up hitting the car behind her whom was actually in a parking space. When she got out of the car, I lite her up. \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING. DON\"T YOU KNOW HOW TO FUCKING DRIVE YOU GODDAMN IDIOT!!!! YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN A PARKING SPACE\". It was the greatest feeling ever after running to just rip into a shitty driver like that.
